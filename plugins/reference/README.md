# Reference

Core plugins come with Athena. They act as standard systems that tap into the various APIs that Athena currently offers. They are meant to be examples on how to write complex systems such as a character creator, clothing shop, dealership, atm system, job framework examples, etc.

They should be your #1 source to get a better understanding of the way that Athena works as a whole. In this category you'll be able to see setup instructions, and general information revolving around how the plugins are used and configured.
