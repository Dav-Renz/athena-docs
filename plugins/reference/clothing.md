# Clothing

### Abstract

The clothing plugin creates multiple clothing shops across the map. They all act the same. They allow the player to customize their clothing and combine different components to create their ideal outfit. All items are separated on purchase, and are not auto-equipped on purchase.

üìÅ `src/core/plugins/core-clothing/`

It allows the player to do the following:

* Select Hat
* Select Shirt
* Select Pants
* Select Bags
* Select Accessories
* etc.

It also includes a standard interface to go with it.
