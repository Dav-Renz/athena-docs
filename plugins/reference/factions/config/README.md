# Config

The current configuration for factions is confusing and will be rather difficult. In the near future it will hopefully be resolved but I can at least state how to handle factions a bit better.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you modify a faction in a database you **must** restart the server.
{% endhint %}

See the sidebar for Configuration sections.
