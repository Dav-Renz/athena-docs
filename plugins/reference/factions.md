# Factions

### Abstract

The faction system is a grouping system for admins to help player's group people together. It can be used for gangs, factions, businesses, etc. The current iteration of Factions **does not** have any built-in factions. You will have to create them yourself.

There is already built-in group management, rank management, bank management, etc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently the Faction Administrative tools are very limited. It's heavily database based.

Below are a few screenshots to help you visualize the features.&#x20;

### Configuration

The current configuration for factions is confusing and will be rather difficult. In the near future it will hopefully be resolved but I can at least state how to handle factions a bit better.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you modify a faction in a database you **must** restart the server.
{% endhint %}

Let's talk about some things.

#### Adding Purchaseable Vehicles

If you have a faction already created, you have to edit the database to add new vehicles. Here's how to do that.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 1" %}
Open MongoDB Compass

Connect to the Database

Go to the Factions Collection

{% tab title="Step 3" %}

Click the `+` to add a new field. It's next to settings.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 4" %}
Name the new field key `vehicles`.

Change the type to Array.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 5" %}
Append a new object to the vehicles array.

It should contain a `model` and a `price`.

Add as many of these as you want.

Remember to hit `update` and restart your server when done.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
